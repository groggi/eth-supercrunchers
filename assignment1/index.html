		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			In the past, we went to the local music store to buy new records and have a good talk with the owner. An important part of those discussions were artists or new music directions we might be interested in. The owner, as the expert, knew our past purchases and taste while being aware of new records and aspiring artist. Nowadays we have tons of items available online for purchase and consume. As there is no staff available, we cannot ask for personal guidance and recommendations, computer systems have to jump in.
		</p>
		<p>
			Recommendation systems are designed to support us finding the products we most likely would be interested in. Those systems use the same data as the owner of our local music store, just in a much larger scale. Recommendations are based on the individual’s history and personal data mixed together with information of thousands of other people.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some companies, like Amazon.com, expect an increase in their sales because of such systems. Other companies even built their whole business model on top of recommendation systems. Last.fm for example provides the user with personalized radio stations and artist recommendations for a small fee. In this way Last.fm acts as the guy behind the desk in your local music store.
		</p>
		<p>
			While this all sounds very convenient, there are downsides. This systems not only show you items you would most likely be interested in, but also hide those it thinks are not of any use to you. This leads to a filtered (in some way even censored) view of the available products that may not allow the consumer to find interesting products “by luck”.

		<h1>Recommendation Systems in the Wild</h1>
		<p>
		Nowadays we use a variety of different recommendation systems. Friends, family and coworkers are for many of us an important source of information. As we spent more and more time on the Internet we rely increasingly on reviews and more importantly on computer based algorithms to show us the way.
		</p>
		<p>
		Recommendation systems are a special class of information filtering systems. They try to filter out items that are of low interest or unwanted for a given situation. As a special case recommendation systems try to predict the rating that a user would give to a specific item they don’t know yet. With this information it is possible to create lists of recommended items.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the following sections we will describe what data is used, the different types of computer based recommendation systems and end the chapter with an example of how a recommendation system is used and how it is implemented.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Data Collection</h2>
		<p>
		For recommendation systems it is vital to collect a big amount of data to create good predictions. The data collection is either explicit or implicit.
		</p>
		<p>
		Explicit data collection happens in form of direct user feedback. The user may rate items, give it a “like” / “dislike” or create wish lists. Both are good sources of data to create a profile of the user’s taste.
		</p>
		<p>
		Implicit data collection is based on the behavior of the user, that can be tracked automatically by computer systems. This includes observing what items the user looked at, how often he/she searched for an item, already purchased items, analyzing his social network, etc.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Collaborative Filtering</h2>
		<p>
		A recommendation system based on the idea of collaborative filtering is trying to predict the users taste and preference for products unknown to him, based on the similarity to other users. It is essential for this systems to have some initial data about the user. A new user without any data is often asked for some initial data, like his favorite artists or songs. The situation of a new user without initial data is called a “cold start”<sup><a href="#ref1">(1)</a></sup> and must in some way be addressed.
		</p>
		<p>
		Collaborative filtering biggest advantage is that there is no data needed about the products. The filtering is solely based on the history of users and their similarity between each other. However, the system needs enough data of every user, to get started with finding similarities between them and to find items unknown to a user but known to his similar peers. This is a huge problem for big companies selling a huge amount of different items. Every user has only contact with a very small part of the sold items and because of this, it’s harder to find similar users that can be used for recommendations.<sup><a href="#ref2">(2)</a></sup>
		</p>
		<p>
		For complex items, like movies and songs, that are hard to categorize and describe, it is preferable to use a recommendation system based on collaborative filtering.
		</p>
		<p>
		To summarize it up: ‘[...] in collaborative recommendation one identifies users whose tastes are similar to those of the given user and recommends items they have liked’<sup><a href="#ref3">(3)</a></sup>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Content-based filtering</h2>
		<p>
		In contrast to collaborative filtering which is based on similarity between users, content-based filtering tries to find similarities between items. Recommendation systems using content-based filtering, evaluate historical data about the user and recommend similar items to the ones the user already liked.
		</p>
		<p>
		To get this systems started, every product needs his own profile, which is based on a finite list of attributes. This attributes are afterwards used by the algorithms to find similar items with similar attributes. For better results attributes are often weighted and direct user feedback is incorporated.
		</p>
		<p>
		Content-based filtering is useful in situations with a specific set of product categories. For example: If a user bought a bunch of books, a content-based recommendation system would start to recommend only books, like the ones the user bought. This is fine for a store selling only books, but would be troublesome for sites like Amazone.com which sell a lot of different product types.
		</p>
		<p>
		To summarize this: ‘In content-based recommendation one tries to recommend items similar to those a given user has liked in the past [...]’<sup><a href="#ref3">(3)</a></sup>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Last.fm</h2>
		<p>
		<a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> is a social network with a music recommendation system. Every user can track the music he or she is listening to with provided software.
		</p>
		<p>
		Last.fm uses the aggregated data of listening habits for multiple services to the user. The most simple ones are: lists of artists the user has listened to, the last listened tracks and a Top 15 list of the most listened tracks and artists. The second use of the collected data is provided in form of personal radio stations. This radio stations use the available data of the current user and all others to play the best mix of tracks. This mix is made of songs, the user liked in the past or listened a lot and new ones that the recommendation system generates based on the behavior of similar user. Every user can teach the system, to provide better results, by direct user feedback with a “Love Track” or “Ban Track” button. The third service of Last.fm is the “Similar Artists” / “Neighbors” feature. By visiting the profile of an artist, the user gets a list of similar artists based on the collected data of all users. The “Neighbors” functionality allows a user to find other people with similar music preferences.
		</p>
		<p>
		Last.fm has many ways to make money out of its system. The two most visible ones are ads on their site and the fees users pay for the personal radio stations. Another source of income comes from hyperlinks to online stores like Amazon.com or iTunes. The company is also sitting on a big amount of valuable data that fuels their business. It’s safe to say that Last.fm has a business soely based on its recommendation system. Even Ads only pay off if they get enough page views, which is directly connected with the usefulness of their website and this again is connected with their recommendation systems. The money they make, is directly connected to the quality of the system’s recommendations. Data is their business.
		</p>
		<p>
		The recommendation system is based on the idea, that every user and artist is represented as a node in a graph. Between these nodes are edges with a weight. This weight represents the strength of the connection. The stronger the connection the more important it is. A strong connection between two users, represents a friendship in the social network. Loose connections between two users represent neighbors with similar taste.
		Every time a user listens to a song the connection between the user and the artist is strengthened. The recommendation system works on the idea of closing local triads in the network. If a user A is befriended with user B, they have a strong connection in the graph. Let’s assume user B listens a lot to an artist X, which user A never heard of. In this situation, there is a strong connection from A to B and one from B to X but no connection between A and X. The recommendation system would now recommend A to listen to the artist X, in order to close the triad of nodes.<sup><a href="#ref1">(1)</a></sup>
		</p>
		<p>
		This type of recommendation system represents an implementation of a Collaborative Filtering. It makes sense, as music is a very complex product which is hard to describe with a given set of finite attributes. Last.fm also doesn’t have to collect information by hand, about every single artist, the users do it for them automatically by listening to music and rating it.
		</p>
		
		<h1>Societal Impact</h1>
		<p>
		Data suggests<sup><a href="#ref4">(4)</a></sup>, that recommendation systems are beneficial for businesses and because of that, we can expect to see them expanding into new areas and become omnipresent. Netflix reports, that 60% of their movie rentals are based on their recommendation system, 35% of Amazon.com sells are based on recommendations at their website and news articles get 38% more views because of personalized news feeds on Google News.
		</p>
		<p>
		Although recommendation systems seem very useful, as they save us time and generate more revenue, there are also some downsides to consider. We strongly recommend you to watch the TED talk below, which takes a look on how Google Search is personalized for every user. The speaker presents the hypothesis, that information filtering systems give the user a very narrow view of the world with disturbing implications.

		</p>
		<p>
		Another point to consider, is the fact, that companies are actively collecting data about us which could not only be used to help us find the stuff we’re searching for, but also to manipulate us, create detailed profiles about our habits and much more. In Europe the discussion around privacy and data collection is an ongoing discussion and restrictive laws should protect us for now from being a “transparent citizen” as in Orwell’s book 1984. In this context, we should also consider how companies could manipulate us by hiding information. Google, for example, could  hide Google related bad press in their search service.
		</p>
		
		<h1>Scientific Research</h1>
		<p>
		As we stated in the last chapter, we can expect an increase in usage of recommendation systems, which leads to a high demand for research in this field. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) organizes a yearly conference around the topic of recommendation systems called “RECSYS” (<a href="http://www.recsys.acm.org">http://www.recsys.acm.org</a>).
		</p>
		<p>
		The need for improvements in recommendation systems, is best shown by the Netflix Prize started in 2006. The grand prize money of USD 1,000,000 was given to a group called “BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos”. The goal was to find a recommendation system with 10% better results as the one which was in use as the contest started. We strongly recommend to watch the following video with interviews highlighting Bell and Volinksy, two team members of the winning team. A very interesting aspect of this challenge is, that Netflix never implemented the winning algorithm. Mostly due to the reason that the engineering effort was too high and the change Netflix had undergone, from a rental service to a streaming service, while to contest was running.<sup><a href="#ref5">(5)</a></sup>
